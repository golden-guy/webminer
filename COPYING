Webminer uses code that is forked from Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin code
was licensed to the Webminer Developers under the terms of the MIT
license (see: mit-license.txt).

However all changes made by the Webminer Developers has copyright held
by the Webminer Developers and is licensed only under the terms of the
Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 (see: MPL-2-0.txt).

As permitted by the MIT license, the Bitcoin portions are sublicensed
for distribution under the terms of the Mozilla Public License Version
2.0, and so the combined work is distributed under the conjunctive
terms of BOTH licenses, and BOTH licenses must be observed for any
source or binary distribution, or future fork or derived work.
